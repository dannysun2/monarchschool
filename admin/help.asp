<p>This system was designed to track student test performance and graphically display both individual students’ progress since enrollment and also the progress of students across individual levels of study.</p>

<h2>STUDENT RECORDS</h2>

<h3>How do I search for students?</h3>
<p>On the site’s top page beneath the graph area, look for the text box labeled “Find A Student” and click it to activate it. Begin typing the first few letters of the target student’s last name. You will see the list of students below actively update as you type.</p>

<p><small><strong>Note:</strong> If the student you are looking for does not appear, make sure you are typing the student’s last name and also double-check the last name’s spelling. The student you are searching for might not yet be in the database.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>Tip: </strong>When the search box is empty, hit the Backspace key on your keyboard to see a list of all students currently in the database.</small></p>

<h3>How do I add a student?</h3>
<p>Click the Add Student link in the menu at the top of the page. Once you do so, you will be taken to the Add Student page on which you can enter all of the necessary data for the student you wish to add. All fields are mandatory except for Middle Name, which may be left blank.</p>

<p>Once you have entered all of the data for the student and have also verified that all of the data is correct, press the Submit button. The student will be added to the database and you will be taken back to the home page, from which you may add another student or search for the student you added.</p>

<p><small><strong>Note: </strong>All student data can later be modified from the Modify Student screen. (See “How do I modify a student?” below.)</small></p>

<h3>How do I modify a student?</h3>

<p>Occasionally, you will find that a student record needs to be updated, such as when a student moves into another school program or if erroneous data was entered in the past and needs to be updated.</p>

<p><small><strong>Warning:</strong> Not all users have access to modify records. If you do not, please speak with the school’s designated administrator.</small></p>

<p>To modify a student’s data, you must first search for that student. (See the instructions above in “How do I search for students?”)</p>


<p>Once you see the target student in the list of search results, you will see a pencil icon at the beginning of that line. Press the pencil icon to bring up the Modify Student screen. This screen is almost identical to the Add Student screen and behaves the same way. Change any data that needs to be updated and press Submit.</p>

<h3>How do I delete a student?</h3>

<p>There might rarely be a case in which a student record needs to be deleted from the system.</p>

<p><small><strong>Warning: </strong>Not all users have access to delete records. If you do not, please speak with the school’s designated administrator.</small></p>

<p>To delete a student record (which will, in turn, deleted all test results to which that student is linked), first, search for the student in question and find his or her name in the search results. (See the instructions above in “How do I search for students?”) Click the icon on the left (under “Student ID”) to bring up the student’s record page.</p>

<p>On the student record page, press “Delete Student” at the upper right corner of the page to delete the current student from the database permanently.</p>

<p><small><strong>Warning: </strong>All test results entered for deleted students will automatically be deleted as well! Be careful with this function.</small></p>

<h2>TEST RESULTS</h2>

<p>Test results can be recorded for each student in the database. Each time a student takes a test and those scores are added to the database, a new test record is created on that student’s record page.</p>

<h3>How do I view a student’s test results?</h3>

<p>First, search for the student in question and find his or her name in the search results. (See the instructions above in “How do I search for students?”) Click the icon on the left to bring up the student record. All of the student’s test results will be listed beneath a graph displaying the results from the student’s two most recent tests.</p>

<h3>How do I add a new student test result?</h3>

<p>To add the results of a test, first open the Student Record and then click the Add Grades link near the upper right corner of the screen. On the following page, enter the grades earned on each section of the test and then click the Submit button. You should see a message confirming that the grades have been added.</p>

<p>Once back on the Student Page, you will see that the graph at the top has been updated to reflect the latest data. Beneath that, you will also see that the list of exam results has been updated with a new line that contains the latest results.</p>

<p><small><strong>Note:</strong> If the test results added are not for one of the most two most recent tests, then they will not appear in the test results.</small></p>

<h3>How do I modify a student test result?</h3>

<p>On the Student Record page, find the test result that you want to modify and then select the pencil icon in the Modify column. On the following page, make the edits that need to be made and then hit press the Submit button.</p>

<p><small><strong>Warning: </strong>Not all users have access to modify records. If you do not, please speak with the school’s designated administrator.</small></p>

<h3>How do I delete a student test result?</h3>

<p>On the Student Record page, find the test result that you want to delete and then select the “X” icon in the Delete column. On the following page, confirm that you want to permanently remove the data for that test by pressing Submit. The test result will be removed and you will be returned to the student record.</p>

<p><small><strong>Warning: </strong>Not all users have access to delete records. If you do not, please speak with the school’s designated administrator.</small></p>

<h2>REPORT GRAPHS</h2>

<p>The Reports section of the site allows you to graphically see the progress that the entire school or just a single level of students has made between two specified dates.</p>

<p>When you click on the Reports link on the main site menu, you will be taken to a screen on which you will choose the starting date and the ending date (inclusive) of the period that you want to see results for. Additionally, you will choose whether you will see the results for the entire school or only students that are currently in a certain program.</p>
